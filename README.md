### Project Overview
This project involves performing a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a chocolate sales dataset. The goal was to clean the data, identify sales patterns, and visualize key performance metrics.

### Key Steps Performed:
1. **Data Cleaning:** - Converted the `Date` column to a proper datetime format.
   - Cleaned the `Amount` column by removing currency symbols (`$`, `,`) and converting it to a numeric float for analysis.
2. **Univariate Analysis:** Explored the distribution of boxes shipped and total revenue.
3. **Bivariate Analysis:** - Analyzed total revenue by Country and Product.
   - Investigated the relationship between shipment volume and revenue.
4. **Time-Series Analysis:** Visualized the Monthly Revenue Trend to identify seasonal peaks and valleys in sales performance.
5. **Correlation Analysis:** Generated a heatmap to examine the influence of variables on each other.
